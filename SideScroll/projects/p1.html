<h2> Ocean and Cloud Rendering </h2>
		<p> 9/16/2013</p> <br> 
		<p> As part of a final project for a class, 
		I worked on the advanced graphical aspects which included an ocean as well clouds. These two 
		effects were based off of the papers <i> Simulating Ocean Water </i> by Jerry Tessendorf, 
		<i> Animation and Display of Water  </i> by Stefano Lanza, and <i> Real-Time Cloud Rendering for Games </i> 
		by Mark J. Harris. Direct3D10 was used for rendering.
